# Merge Sort

This is a classic sorting algorithm for which there is plenty of documentation about. This project contains a module with the merge sort methods implementing this algorithm. I've added a unit test to determine whether any changes to the source code effects the outcome of the sorted list. The biggest learning experience was implementing this on my own and by learning about the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) in python.
