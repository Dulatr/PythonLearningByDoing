# The Classic FizzBuzz Problem

Long have people referenced the FizzBuzz problem as an interview problem to candidates. It may seem like a straightforward problem, but it appears to have been successful in many situations for weeding out candidates. This project sets out to ensure that I've familiarized myself with the problem. Even though there are many available answers online, the true evaluation of your answer is whether or not it prints the correct answer. Anyone else reading this project description I hope that you don't look at the answer unless you've tried it for yourself.

## The problem

> "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

Therefore you should expect numbers like 15 and 30 to be replaced with FizzBuzz. 

Generally, those who struggle to code do so even on tiny problems such as this. If you don't immediately get the problem correct don't be harsh on yourself. Take more time and practice with programming things outside the scope of what's widely available along side small challenges such as this. With time you'll be able to overcome it, focus on the details of *what* the code is doing. This is what I am going to be focusing on in this repo.
