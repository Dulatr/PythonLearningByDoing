# Python Learning By Doing

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to provide a place for small projects that I create while learning more Python. You can find the list of projects that I attempted are based on a project list [here](https://github.com/karan/Projects).

## Layout 

The structure will be based on the type of project that is added. For starters the Numbers folder will contain some programs that play with general mathematical problems.
