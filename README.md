# Python Learning By Doing

A repository of small projects written in python. These will be written in `Python3.8` and might not work for older versions (in some cases before `Python3.6`). I particularly  prefer using **f-literals** introduced in [PEP 498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/).

## Goal(s)

The goal of this repository is to provide a place for small projects that I create while learning more Python. You can find the list of projects that I will attempt are based on a [project list](https://github.com/karan/Projects). These are not guaranteed full solutions; if you are looking for that I suggest only doing a cursory glance over my work to help you start. I am putting my own spin on them just to expand my knowledge of python and various third party modules in each project, so they will likely contain features that might seem overkill for such short topics.

Since it requires a lot of time and dedication to become 'good' at programming, I will keep with maintaining and expanding this repository throughout the year and possibly beyond. All of this is being done in junction with my [github web page](https://github.com/Dulatr/dulatr.github.io) and I'm aiming for the ultimate goal of breaking into industry. I was inspired by [another user's repo](https://github.com/udohsolomon/My_python_deliberate_practice) to start this one, and will somewhat follow in those footsteps for my own personal growth. In doing so I can hope to achieve:

1. Full language literacy
2. A habit of commiting to programming and writing at least once a day
3. Ability to start and complete more complex projects
4. Learn more about coding standards that can be seen in industry

## Project Layout

The structure will be based on the type of project that is added. For starters the Numbers folder will contain some programs that play with general mathematical problems. An example tree below:

```bash
├── PythonLearningByDoing
│   ├── Category
│   │   └── Project 
│   │   │   ├── *.py
│   │   │   └── README.md
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── README.md
```
After the initial commit, any pushed changes will have commit messages with specified lables:

* **Maintain**
    - If something is noticed to not operate as intended after a commit, changes to this will be labeled **Maintain**. 
* **Chore**
    - Updates to README files and comments with in code, along with any addition of README files must be labeled **Chore**.
* **Feature**
    - If at some point there is an idea to expand a project's operation, any accepted changes must have message label **Feature**
* **Project**
    - Any intial addition of a base project will be labeled **Project**.
